fl-parser: Functional logic parser combinators
==============================================

This package contains a library with functional logic parser combinators.

The idea and structure of these combinators are adapted from:

    Rafael Caballero and Francisco J. Lopez-Fraguas:
    A Functional Logic Perspective of Parsing.
    In Proc. FLOPS'99, Springer LNCS 1722, pp. 85-99, 1999

This paper contains a detailed description of the idea and usage
of these parser combinators.

The `examples` directory contains some examples for using
these combinators for parsing.
